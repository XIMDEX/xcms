Installation
------------

First check whether this package can be installed by the
distribution that you use, since that will simplify installation.
For manual installations, the structure and supposed location in a
TDS compliant TeX-tree is shown in the overview below. In words,
keyval.tex, pst-xkey.tex, xkvtxhdr.tex and xkeyval.tex should be
available to TeX and LaTeX; pst-xkey.sty, xkeyval.sty, xkvview.sty
and xkvltxp.sty should be available to LaTeX. The package to which a
specific run file belongs, is denoted in between square brackets.
Don't forget to update your filename database after installing the
files.

The package includes pregenerated run and doc files, but you can
reproduce them from the source if necessary. See the first lines
of xkeyval.dtx for information how to do this. Example files can
be produced by running the file xkeyval.dtx with LaTeX once.
